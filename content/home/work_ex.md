- **Deep Learning Intern**, The Climate Corporation (Summer 2018) 

     As part of the Sead and Placement team at [The Climate Corporation](https://www.climate.com/), I worked on the development  of a weather-modelling approach for seeding rate prediction.
	   - Developed deep unsupervised architecture to generate features from multi-variatetime-series weather information.
	   - Designed transfer learning approach to use weather features developed, in a supervised machine learning algorithms to predict optimal seeding rate. The model will be deployed as part of the fieldview application.
  
- **Natural Language Processing Engineer**, Citi Group (July 2016 - June 2017)

     Worked on the developement of Chat Bot for Real-time Financial Trading at [Citi group](https://www.citigroup.com/citi/). As part of the NLP team, I performed the following tasks:

     -  Developed regular expressions to capture financial entities from the unstructured financial text data.
     -  Developed and tuned classification models to classify between different financial entities (swaps vs bonds).
     -  Developed a Named Entity Recognizer to detect entities in a financial chat.
     -  Developed a deep learning model which can classify between financial vs social texts and a deep Learning model which can extract Ticker information from an unstructured text.
     -  Improved performance of the reference data mapper using Bloomfilters.
          
   
- **Application Developer**, Citi Group (July 2015 - June 2016)

     Worked on the development Java module for automated Runbook generation.
     -  The runbook module reduced the man hours required for runbook creation by 40%.
     -	Designed modules for Runbook version control, approval workflow and notification alerts.
     -	The runbook module, centralized the data storage providing scope for future data analysis on a large data corpus.
     -	Developed the module using core Java, JDBC, Google Web Toolkit(GWT), Hibernate, SQL.
     -  Performed POC on blockchain for Reconciliation, proving blockchain helps in avoiding the expensive process of end-of-day internal reconciliations.
     -	Presented *“Blockchain and it's use cases in Financial Institutions”* at the Citi Annual Town Hall’2016.
